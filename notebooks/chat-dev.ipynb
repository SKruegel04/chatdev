      "1. **User Authentication**: Since it's a member portal, we should have a secure login and sign-up process to authenticate members.\n",
      "2. **Events Information**: A section that lists upcoming events with details such as date, time, and location, as well as a feature for members to RSVP.\n",
      "3. **News Updates**: A dynamic section where the latest news relevant to members can be posted and easily updated by portal admins.\n",
      "4. **Blog**: A blog section where articles can be published, categorized, and archived. This should also include commenting functionality for member engagement.\n",
      "5. **Responsive Interface**: Ensuring that the portal is accessible and user-friendly across all devices.\n",

      "6. **Notification System**: To alert members about new events, news updates, and blog posts.\n",
      "7. **User Profiles**: Enable members to create and edit their profiles, which can be used for networking within the portal.\n",
      "8. **Search and Filtering**: To allow members to easily find past events, news, or blog posts based on their interests or categories.\n",

      "3. **News Feed Engine**: Designing a dynamic content system with roles for authors and editors, including version control for posts.\n",
      "4. **Blog Platform**: Supporting rich text editing, media attachments, categories/tags, and a comment moderation system.\n",
      "5. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring a mobile-first approach with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or TailwindCSS.\n",

      "**Architecture:**\n",
      "- **Authentication Service**: Utilizes OAuth and PyOTP for two-factor authentication, with Flask Blueprints for modularity.\n",
      "- **Event Management**: Provides CRUD operations for events linked with a calendar API for scheduling.\n",
      "- **News Feed**: A dynamic content management system with roles and version control.\n",
      "- **Blog**: Features a rich text editor, media attachments, tagging, categorization, and user comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Technology Stack:**\n",
      "- **Backend**: Python with Flask framework.\n",
      "- **Database**: PostgreSQL deployed on a managed DB service such as AWS RDS.\n",
      "- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap for responsive design), JavaScript.\n",
      "- **External Libraries**: PyOTP for 2FA, Flask-OAuthlib for OAuth authentication.\n",
      "- **Other Tools**: Elasticsearch for search and filtering functionality, WebSocket for real-time notifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Database Schema:**\n",
      "- Users: Stores user credentials, profile information, and 2FA secrets.\n",
      "- Events: Contains event details, RSVP records, and calendar links.\n",
      "- News: Manages news posts along with author and edit history.\n",
      "- Blog: Holds blog posts, comments, categories, and media references.\n",
      "\n",
      "**API Endpoints:**\n",

Be sure to detail each component with specific class and method descriptions, expected input/output, and potential edge cases that the code handles. Also, include any setup instructions, environment variables, and deployment steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you've expanded on these sections and included the sample request/response for the API endpoints, we should have a complete technical specification that would serve as a valuable guide for anyone who works on this project in the future. Please update the document accordingly.\n",
