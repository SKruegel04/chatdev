      "1. **Modularize Your Codebase:**\n",
      "   Split different functionalities into separate modules and use Blueprints in Flask to organize your application into distinct components. This will make the code easier to navigate and work on.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use ORM for Database Interactions:**\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Implement Proper Error Handling:**\n",
      "   Expand upon your error handling to manage exceptions gracefully. This could include handling database errors, form validation errors, and HTTP errors with proper user feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Enhance Security Measures:**\n",
      "   Alongside password hashing, implement other security practices such as user input sanitation to prevent XSS attacks, and use Flask-Talisman to enforce HTTPS and other security headers.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Introduce Caching Where Appropriate:**\n",
      "   For static or slow-changing data, such as the list of events or news articles, consider using a caching mechanism to improve the performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Optimize for Concurrency:**\n",
      "   Design the application with concurrency in mind. Make sure that database transactions are handled correctly to avoid issues with multiple users accessing or modifying data simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Programmer, please make these changes to your code. After you've made the revisions based on these architectural improvements, let me revisit the code before we finalize. This will guarantee that we deliver a well-designed product that is robust and scalable.\n",

      "3. Comprehensive error handling will be added to manage different types of exceptions and provide appropriate feedback to the user.\n",
      "4. Additional security measures will be implemented, including input sanitation and setting security headers with Flask-Talisman.\n",
