# Cloning and opening

1. Clone the repository
2. Open repository in VSCode
3. Click "Open in container" in the notification at the bottom right
4. Copy `OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample` and create a `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` file from it, provide a proper GPT4 key in it

If the notification doesn't appear, use `F1` and enter `reopen` to find the
`Rebuild and reopen in container` command.
